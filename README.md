# Comprehensive-cricket-analysis-using-relational-DBMS
Conceptualized an RDBMS by formulating an Entity-relationship Diagram based on the Dataset comprising of 577 games and 21 csv files and formulated the 25 desired user-oriented SQL Queries to elicit actionable insights and not so keen on the eye statistic from the schema.  


**What does this project hope to achieve? **

a. Understand the complex Kaggle Indian Premier Dataset precisely and create a relational DBMS using the concepts we learn from the class like constructing an ERD, also mapping it to the tables among other steps.  

b. Pre-process the chosen data and implement some insightful Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) like understanding the distribution particularly from a cricket point of view as in how many left hand batters exist, how many right hand batters exist, also how many matches are being played at different venues among others  

c. To ultimately formulate desired user-oriented SQL queries that can effectively use the massive amounts of available data of Indian Premier League in the world to answer some inquisitive questions the end user might have.  

d. Also understand how much time each query is taking to execute, and discuss various query optimization techniques to improve this run time and finally plot the results.
